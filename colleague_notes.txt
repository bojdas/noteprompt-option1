This is set of statements about Cenobamate from experts:
Cenobamate should be used only as a second line agent in focal epilepsy.
Cenobamate has significant drug-drug interactions with enzyme inducing anti-seizure medications, therefore it might not be considered second line if the first medication was an enzyme inducer.
When a patient has failed multiple anti-seizure medications, cenobamate may be a better choice than other anti-seizure medications.
